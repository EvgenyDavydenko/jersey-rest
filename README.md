## Jersey-quickstart-archetype Hello World Application

Jersey RESTful Web Services framework is open source, production quality, framework for developing RESTful Web Services in Java that provides support for JAX-RS APIs and serves as a JAX-RS (JSR 311 & JSR 339) Reference Implementation. Jersey framework is more than the JAX-RS Reference Implementation. Jersey provides it's own API that extend the JAX-RS toolkit with additional features and utilities to further simplify RESTful service and client development.

In this example, we will create a jersey RESTful API web application using jersey-quickstart-webapp maven archetype

`mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.glassfish.jersey.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=jersey-quickstart-webapp -DarchetypeVersion=3.1.0`
